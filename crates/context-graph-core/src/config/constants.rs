//! Centralized constants from constitution.yaml.
//!
//! This module extracts magic numbers into named constants with documentation
//! citing their source in the constitution. All thresholds and constants that
//! were previously hardcoded are now centralized here for:
//!
//! 1. Single source of truth
//! 2. Clear constitution traceability
//! 3. Easy configuration updates
//! 4. Test consistency
//!
//! # Constitution Reference
//!
//! All values here come from `/docs2/constitution.yaml` sections:
//! - `teleological.thresholds` - Alignment thresholds
//! - `embeddings.similarity` - RRF and similarity constants
//! - `forbidden.AP-003` - "Magic numbers -> define constants"
